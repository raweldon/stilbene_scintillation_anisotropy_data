# stilbene_scintillation_anisotropy_data
Measured and smoothed light output and pulse shape parameter anisotropy for recoil proton energies between 0.56 and 10 MeV 

## Text files    
The measured and smoothed data are listed in ascii files.  Each file contains the light output or pulse shape parameter values for a given recoil proton energy along with the direction of the given parameter with respect to the crystal axes.

### Contents
Each text file is composed of 4 or 5 columns.  Column 1 is the light ouptput (MeVee) or pulse shape parameter (unitless).  Columns 2 - 4 are the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.  The measured data has a 5th column with the crystal used for a given measurement listed.

## Viewing data
view_data.py is provided to view the data relative and plot it w.r.t. the crystal axes.
