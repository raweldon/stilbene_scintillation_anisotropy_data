# stilbene_scintillation_anisotropy_data
Measured and smoothed light output and pulse shape parameter anisotropy for recoil proton energies between 0.56 and 10 MeV.

## Text files    
The measured and smoothed data are listed in ascii files. 

The text files are composed of 6 or 8 columns.  Column 1 lists the light ouptput (MeVee) or pulse shape parameter (unitless).  Column 2 lists the light ouput or pulse shape parameter uncertainty.  Columns 3 - 5 list the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.  Column 6 lists the recoil proton energy and uncertainty.  The measured data has a two additional columns.  Column 7 lists the recoil proton energy uncertainty.  Column 8 lists the crystal used for the measurement.

## Viewing data
view_data.py is provided to plot the data w.r.t. the crystal axes. 
It contains a function to plot the data in 3D and a function to plot the data using Lambert azimuthal equation area projection (including the light output uncertainties).
